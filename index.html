      ishing may seem complicated to first-time anglers, but that doesn’t have to be the case. With just a bit of gear, a fishing license, and the information in this guide, you’ll be able to get on the water and try your hand at catching some fish by this weekend.

This guide specifically covers spin fishing, which uses a rod with a spinning reel and lures or live bait to attract fish. For new anglers, it’s one of the easiest ways to get outside with minimal investment, but fly-fishing, saltwater fishing, ice fishing, and other types of gear fishing that utilize different reels are all options that may interest you down the road.

      <p>
        When it comes to deciding how to choose bait for fishing, there are key distinctions between natural bait vs artificial that new anglers should learn. While using bait that is more appropriate to the kind of fishing you are planning to do is important, the good news is that fish like both artificial fishing bait and natural fishing bait.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Consider what fish eat. Live (or natural) baits are anything alive or previously alive that you use to catch fish. Some of the best freshwater fishing bait include worms, leeches, minnows, crayfish, crickets and grasshoppers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Select good saltwater baits including sea worms, eels, crabs, shrimp, strips of squid, and cut-up pieces of fish. You can purchase live bait, or better yet, find your own to save money.
        </li>
        <li>
          Always check your fishing regulations to make sure the bait you choose is legal where you’re fishing. And keep in mind that live bait only catches fish if you take steps to keep it alive and cast gently so it remains on the hook.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are using artificial bait or imitation choose among spinners, jigs, poppers, flies, and spoons that come in various sizes, styles, colors and patterns. When used, these are seen by fish as a natural food such as a minnow or mayfly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Check your budget. While bait fishing can be less expensive, the best types of fishing lures can be more fun because the lure needs the angler to provide the motion – giving you complete control. Just be sure to read the instructions on a lure package to learn how to use each lure.
        </li>
        <li>
          Learn about the differences between natural bait vs artificial to understand how to choose bait for fishing. There are advantages and disadvantages to both kinds, so whatever type of freshwater or saltwater baits and lures you choose, just make sure you know how to choose bait for fishing the species you want to catch.

<header>How To Set The Hook</header>
   <article>
      <p>
        A good rule of thumb when learning how to fish, is to wait and feel the weight of the fish before setting it. If the fish is cautious and just tapping your fishing line and bait lightly, and not biting it, it's best to wait. Let the fish take the bait, and then set the hook after you feel its weight. For best results, be sure to use the proper fishing hook setup. For example, the use of circle baits when fishing catfish often eliminates the need to set the hook, as it generally gets caught in the fish’s mouth automatically.
      </p>
   <ol>
     <h2>STEPS TO SET UP A HOOK</h2>
     <li>To help you better know how to set the hook, look for common signs a fish is biting such us: your bobber is pulled completely underwater, you feel a true tug on your fishing line or your fishing line starts moving.
     </li>
     <li>
       Reel in slack and keep your line tight with the bait or lure. This helps increase the sensitivity allowing you to feel the fish bite and be in a better position to set the hook.
     </li>
     <li>
       The motion of setting the hook is relatively simple. But it can sometimes be difficult to tell if you have a bite or if you're just feeling the current or a fish bumping into the bait.
     </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
     The more you know about the fish species you’re after, and the more time you spend on the water practicing, the better you’ll get. So grab the proper fishing hook setup and maximize your catches!

<header>How To Set The Drag</header>
          <article>
      <p>
        You’ve cast your line, lured in a fish, got a bite and set the hook. You’re now ready to reel the fish in. The last thing you want to experience during this phase in learning how to fish is a broken line. Most breaks can be easily avoided while drag fishing by learning how to set drag on your fishing reel. </p>

       <p> 
What is drag fishing? Simply put, if you’re using a fishing rod and reel setup, as opposed to, say, pole fishing or trawling with a net, you will most likely adjust the drag at some point. 

The drag is simply a pair of friction plates inside of fishing reels. If the fish pulls on the line hard enough, the friction is overcome, and the reel rotates backwards, letting line out, preventing the line from breaking.  You want to set the drag on a fishing reel before your first cast of the day. Adjusting it while fighting a fish can be difficult. Also, drag fishing gear is generally not designed to be adjusted while fishing, so doing so could cause damage.
          </p>
          <ol>
          <li>The easiest way to set the drag on a spinning reel or spincast reel is to first test it by using your hand* to pull on your line directly above the reel.
         </li>
            <li>
              Tighten the drag on your spinning wheel by turning the front drag adjustment button a few clicks to the right if the line pulls out too easily. If it’s too tight, loosen the drag by turning the crank a few clicks to the left. Closed face spincast models usually have a top set roller drag adjustment mechanism.
         </li>
            <li>
            If you don’t feel you can judge the force accurately, a small spring scale can help, such as the ones used in Boca Grips or other fish handling devices used in catch and release. Hold your rod at a 45-degree angle and hook the weight. For best results, the drag setting should be able at the point where the line holds a third to half of its weight before moving (e.g., a 20-pound line should not move until the hook holds seven to ten pounds).

             The first step in learning how to catch fish is learning how to cast. Each of these techniques takes a bit of practice. Practice, whether in your backyard or the neighborhood park, will make reel casting second nature, if you give it some time.
            </p>
      <h2>HOW TO CAST SPINNING REELS: STEPS
</h2>
           <p>
             Baitcasting is a style of reel casting that relies on the weight of the lure to extend the line into the target area. Baitcasting involves a revolving-spool fishing reel or "free spool" mounted on the topside of the rod. Learning how to use baitcasting reels is an acquired skill, however, once you get the hang of the technique you will be casting your lures right on target into the structures where fish are feeding and hanging out with these popular saltwater reels.
             </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
             Begin by holding the rod about waist level, grasping it so that the reel is above the rod, and your thumb falls naturally on the bottom of the spool. The bait or lure should be hanging 8 to 10 inches below the tip of the rod.
 </li>
<li>
             Push the button to put the reel in free spool while holding your thumb against the spool to prevent  </li>
<li>
                Pull the rod back so the tip sweeps over your dominant shoulder, and then bring it forward swiftly, pointing the rod tip at your target.
  </li>
<li>
                As the rod comes forward over your shoulder let your thumb off the spool so the lure can pull line from the reel.
   </li>
 <li>
              Place your thumb back down on the spool as the lure splashes into the water.
   </li>
 <li>
            Reel once or twice to engage the anti-reverse and you’re ready to fish.

             If you are planning on cooking your fish whole or if you are going to steak it, rather than filleting it, you must learn how to gut a fish. 
 </p>
<ol>    
 <li>
   To begin, rest the fish on the table or cutting board. Insert the knife tip into the fish's belly near the anal opening and move the blade up along the belly, cutting to the head.
  </li>
 <li>
    Keep the knife blade shallow so you don't puncture the intestines.
  </li>
 <li>
  Spread the body open and remove all of the entrails, locate the fish's anus and cut this out in a "V" or notch shape.
  </li>         
<li>
    Some fish have a kidney by the backbone. Remove it by scraping it out with a spoon or your thumbnail.
  </li>
 <li>
     Rinse the cavity out with a good stream of water and wash the skin. Some fish have a dark tissue lining the abdominal cavity that can be scraped off to prevent a strong, oily flavor.
  </li>
<li>            
    Remove the head if you like, trout are often cooked with the head on. 
  </li>
<li>
   Clean your fish-cleaning table immediately, collect the guts, heads, and scales, and discard them properly.
  </li>
<li>
  Your clean fish is now ready to be cooked.
  </li>
   </ol>
   <h3>HOW TO CLEAN A FISH: TIPS AND WARNINGS</h3>
<p>
  Research the area you're fishing to determine if the fish are safe to eat, some bodies of water are polluted with mercury and other heavy metals that fish absorb. Always check your state regulations before your head out fishing.<br>
 Now that you have a clean fish, or prepared your steaks or fillets, you can store your fish or cook your fish! Check out our favorite cooking methods and recipes as well.

<ul>
 <li>
     Fish fins can be very sharp and cause serious puncture wounds, so be very careful when learning how to gut a fish, fillet a fish or clean a fish whole.
  </li>
 <li>
   Some fish are too bony or strong flavored to be considered edible.
  </li>
<li> Some fish have very sharp teeth, be careful if you're holding a fish by the head while cleaning your fish.
